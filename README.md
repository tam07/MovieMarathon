# MovieLinker
Back in college, when my friends and I wanted to go to the movies we would make a day of it.  We wanted to watch multiple movies.  Often times we couldn't come to a consensus of what to watch.  We spent a lot of time reading information about movies, watching trailers, and most of all coming up with a good viewing schedule.

MovieLinker simplifies all this by:

1.  Allowing you to select a theatre near your current location
2.  Displaying that theatres' offerings
3.  Providing HD trailers
4.  Generating all possible schedules of the selected movies based off the current time.

## Building

The build requires [Gradle](http://www.gradleware.com/)
v1.10 and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `gradle assemble` from the root directory to build the APK only
* Run `gradle build` from the root directory to build the app and also run
  the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running
  emulator.
